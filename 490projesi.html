            <ul>
              <p> Revenue management aims to sell the right product to the right customer at the right time.
Airline industry has a leading role in revenue management. Overbooking is a profitable
strategy which is widely used by airline firms. In this setting, an airline firm needs to make
critical decisions such as to accept a customer request for a seat in a specific time or to
overbook a request in order to manage its revenue. This problem has been modelled using
Markov Decision Processes. In the literature, control limit policy for risk neutral models is
a well-studied subject. In this study, our aim is to show whether a control limit policy exists
for single-leg risk-averse model with overbooking, cancellation and no-shows under coherent
measures of risk. </p>
